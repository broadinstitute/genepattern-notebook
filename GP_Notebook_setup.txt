Some notes on installation of GenePattern Notebook enviornment.

(1) install python

Apple includes an older version of python with MAC OS X.  You will want to replace
this with the most current version of python 2.7; the current offiical release of the
IPython notebook is not compatible with python 3.x.

Updating python would have been straightforward if I had access to the
Admin account on my laptop.  However, even though my user account had
admin privileges, I ran into all sorts of issues when I attempted to
update my python installation using homebrew (the recommended
approach).   In particular, I did not have Homebrew installed on my
system and I did not have the necessary privileges to install
homebrew.  I needed to first install the Xcode command line tools, and
then homebrew.  See
http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/ if you
are interested.  Bottom line was that I could not get Homebrew due to
some permissions issue (running sudo didn't address the issue).

I ended up installing the Anaconda Distribution of python from continuum analytics
(see http://continuum.io/downloads).  Choose the Python 2.7 graphcial
installer for Mac OS X - 64 bit.  That seemed to do the trick.
Another beneifit of installing the Anaconda Distribution is that it is
a scientific distribution of python including with it a very large
number of the most populate Python packages for science, math and data
analysis (e.g., NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, IPython, etc.) 

(2) Install PIP if needed

Install PIP if not already installed (may come with Anaconda installation); see https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html

(3) Install IPython Notebook - see http://ipython.org/install.html
>pip install "ipython[notebook]"

(4) Install jsonpickle

Needed for RNA-Seq notebook document - used to serialization of session state

>pip install -U jsonpickle

(5) clone onto your local system the broadinstitute/GenePatternNotebook private repository, avaialble on GitHub.

Check to see if git client tools are installed on your system.  If
not, go to Github.com to see instructions for getting started with Git
("Set up Git").

You must be a member of the GenePattern Admin team to have access to
the GenePatternNotebook private repository.   Current members are:
Helga, Peter, Bobbie, Marc-Danie, Thorin, Chet, Ted.

(6) Copy files to your ~/.ipython folder

- copy GenePatternNotebook/ipython/extensions/* to
  ~/.ipython/extensions/

- copy GenePatternNotebook/ipython/profile_default/status/custom/* to
  ~/.ipython/profile_default/status/custom/*

Before doing the second copy, you may want to first create backup
copies of the original custom.css and custom.js files, although the
original files are essentially contentless.

(7) Launch ipython notebook and run GenePattern Notebook smoketest

Launch the IPython notebook kernel by issuing the following command at
on a terminal session:

> ipython notebook

This will launch a web page to the notebook kernel.  Navigate into
your cloned repository to the document
GenePatternNotebook/NotebookDocuments/smoketest.ipynb

Click on this document to bring it up in the Notebook client.  You can
now run each cell individually or run them all sequentially by
selecting Run All in the Cell dropdown menu.
